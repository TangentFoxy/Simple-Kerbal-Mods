# Read Me

This is a small collection of minor mods that I have either created or adapted
or done something to and released.

This repo is hosted at https://gitea.tangentfox.com/tangent/Simple-Kerbal-Mods and force-pushed to GitHub when commits are made.

Feel free to submit pull requests or whatever, but know that I would have to manage them over there.

## Downloads

I release these at [KerbalStuff](http://kerbalstuff.com/profile/Guard13007),
however you can also find zip files in the stuff here, which are the same thing.

The exception to this rule is for the Guard13007 Empire Flag zip file, that is
only here, because it's just a flag and doesn't deserve a place at KerbalStuff.
Also I'm probably the only one wanting to use it anyhow.
