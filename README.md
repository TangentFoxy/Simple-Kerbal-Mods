So what is this? It is a small collection of minor mods that I have either
created or adapted or done something to and released. Currently consisting of
two agencies and a flag.

#### Where download release?

I release these at [KerbalStuff](http://kerbalstuff.com/profile/Guard13007), however you can
also find zip files in the stuff here, which are the same thing.

The exception to this rule is for the Guard13007 Empire Flag zip file, that is
only here, because it's just a flag and doesn't deserve a place at KerbalStuff.
Also I'm probably the only one wanting to use it anyhow.
